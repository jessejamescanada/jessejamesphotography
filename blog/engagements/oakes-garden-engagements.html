          Niagara Falls is one of the most romantic places in the world, making
          it a perfect spot for engagement photography. This past summer, one of
          the sweetest couples I have met reached out to me about capturing
          their engagement photos. Their story was extra special because
          Mitchell had proposed to Ali here a year earlier while they were on
          vacation!
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Planning the Engagement Shoot</h2>
        <p>
          Since Ali and Mitchell were visiting Niagara Falls from out of town,
          we planned everything over email. We decided on a few locations that
          included some of Niagara's most beautiful locations. And Ali shared
          some ideas for a few poses which I loved. The weather forecast was a
          bit unpredictable while they would be here, but luckily there was a
          break early one morning which also had the benefit of less people
          being down by Niagara Falls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first location was the Oakes Garden Theatre, located just across
          the street from Niagara Falls. I love taking photos there because it
          has gorgeous gardens, bridges and stonework that give a bunch of
          different looks. From there, we crossed the street to get shots with
          Niagara Falls in the background. Finally, we headed to the Botanical
          Gardens which is one of my favourite spot to photograph at.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>A Picture-Perfect Couple</h2>
        <p>
          When I arrived early that morning and we found each other, I was
          greeted with big smiles. Right away I could tell that Ali and
          Mitchell's excitement and love for each other was obvious. They were
          both friendly and easygoing, and the two of them looked like they
          stepped out of a bridal magazine!
        </p>

        <p>
          As we started the shoot, I gave them some light direction as I always
          do, and very quickly they built off of that and made it their own
          which I love. I always enjoy it when a couple has that perfect
          chemistry and they forget that I'm even there with my camera. There
          was a lot of smiles, laughter, and those special little moments
          in-between with them. And it was honestly just a joy talking with them
          between photos. It was so easy to mesh with them and I find that
          always makes the photos turn out even better.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't think Ali and Mitchell noticed, but while we were at Oakes
          Garden, quite a few tourists stopped and watched as we took photos.
          The two of them are naturals in front of the camera and it was
          noticeable to everyone.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>Beating The Rain At The Botanical Gardens</h2>
        <p>
          We then headed to the Botanical Gardens. On the way there I could see
          the sky was darkening and I was hoping it would hold off long enough
          for us. Once we arrived, every photo with them was so easy, I felt
          like I could've kept taking pictures of them for hours. With how easy
          they were to photograph, we quickly moved through my favourite
          locations at the gardens. Which was a blessing because shortly after
          we finished up the rain came!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They let me know that shortly after our shoot they would be headed
          back home and I couldn't wait to start editing their photos. I'm not
          one to limit the amount of photos from a session and I can proudly say
          that Ali and Mitchell received the most photos I have ever taken
          during an engagement shoot! Trying to choose just a few for this blog
          was challenging.
        </p>

        <p>Congratulations, Ali and Mitchell!</p>

       In my 15-year career as a photographer, I've captured countless
       engagement sessions, but never one at a tulip farm. Thankfully that
       has now changed after photographing Kathryn and Bryan's engagements at
       the Roadside Flower Market in St. Catharines!

       The day before our shoot Kathryn called me to let me know she had
       visited the tulip farm and they said we could use it for their
       engagement photos. I arrived a bit early on the day of their shoot and
       met some of the staff and owners who kindly welcomed me into the barn
       where they shared some history about the farm. The grounds were
       beautiful. There was tulips as far as the eye can see, a windmill, and
       a vintage 1960's Mustang surrounded by a sea of colourful tulips. Just
       stunning!

       Kathryn and Bryan were amazing to work with. They live overseas and
       I'll be photographing their wedding later this summer but this was the
       first time we met in person. The chemistry the two of them have is
       unmatched. There was so many laughs and good photography opportunities
       with how they interact with each other. I love when couples forget
       about me and just laugh and joke with each other and I capture those
       little moments in-between.

       After we finished up with their engagement photos we went around the
       tulip farm and got to pick our own bouquets to bring home. What an
       added bonus!

       "articleBody": "One of the best parts about being a photographer in the Niagara region
       is having the opportunity to photography couples from all over the
       world who come to Niagara Falls for their elopement. It's such an
       iconic spot and the waterfall is a beautiful backdrop for a small
       wedding.

       Damaris and Denzel contacted me a couple of months ago. They let me
       know they would be having a destination wedding ceremony at Niagara
       Falls City Hall and then wanted to have their photos down by the
       Falls. We did an early morning shoot by Niagara Falls before it got
       too busy and the light coming through was perfect for photos.

       Damaris and Denzel were the cutest couple. The laughs and smiles they
       shared throughout their portraits was awesome to capture. It was their
       first time ever visiting Niagara Falls and it was a joy to see their
       reaction when they first saw the waterfalls. Getting to know them a
       little during the shoot was great, and learning that they are huge dog
       lovers like myself just made me like them even more!"

        <h2>Brittany and Ada's Wedding Story</h2>
        <p>
          Last summer I had the joy of photographing Brittany and Ada's
          beautiful wedding at Ball's Falls. The two of them put together a
          heartfelt celebration with their closest family and friends, creating
          a day filled with love, laughter, and thoughtful moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, when I blog about a wedding, I jump straight into how the
          day unfolded. But this time, I want to start by talking about Brittany
          and Ada themselves. From the moment I met them for a consultation to
          discuss their wedding, I could tell they were truly kindhearted,
          genuine people. It wasn't just about how happy they made each other—it
          was clear they cared deeply about everyone around them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Brittany and Ada chose to have their ceremony outside, behind the Glen
          Elgin building at Ball's Falls. It's a stunning spot on that patio
          surrounded by towering trees and rugged boulders. It rained some
          before their wedding began and the summer heat and humidity were
          intense. During the ceremony, I could feel myself getting lightheaded
          and I could feel tunnel vision beginning. Something I have never
          experienced at a wedding before. I remembered a piece of advice a
          minister once gave me: if the heat starts getting to you, keep moving
          slightly to help circulation. I did just that, and thankfully,
          everything went smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, while taking portraits of Brittany and Ada, I casually
          mentioned how the heat had almost gotten to me. To my surprise, a
          little while later one of their best friends came over with food and
          water for me. They must have mentioned something to their friend while
          I was setting something up or changing lessons or something, but what
          a kind gesture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here they were, on their wedding day, surrounded by their favorite
          people, yet they still took a moment to make sure I was okay. That
          small act of kindness spoke volumes about the kind of people they are,
          and it's something I won't forget.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>A Picture-Perfect Celebration at Ball's Falls</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the heat, the day was absolutely beautiful. Brittany and Ada
          had their first look near the rustic barns at Ball's Falls, and
          capturing their expressions when they saw each other for the first
          time was incredible. We spent time exploring the grounds for portraits
          before their heartfelt ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          After they officially tied the knot, we took family photos before
          heading into the Glen Elgin room for a cozy reception filled with
          delicious food and heartfelt speeches. Every moment of their day
          reflected their love for each other and the people around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an absolute joy to capture Brittany and Ada's wedding at Ball's
          Falls, and I couldn't be happier for them. Congratulations, you two!

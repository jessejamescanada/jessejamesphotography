          Louise and Jon had a late summer wedding at Maple Meadows Farm in Port
          Colborne, and it was one of those days that just felt easy from the
          moment I walked in. Warm weather, a beautiful property, a barn
          reception with a cozy rustic vibe… and two people who clearly adore
          each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          I arrived at Maple Meadows Farm and met Louise upstairs in the Loft
          while she was getting ready. Even though I hadn't met either of them
          in person before (they live a few hours away), it genuinely didn't
          matter. I was greeted by a gorgeous bride surrounded by friends and
          family, and the energy in the room was pure excitement.
        </p>
        <h2>A Late Summer Maple Meadows Farm Wedding in Port Colborne</h2>
        <p>
          There's something about late August weddings that's hard to beat. The
          light is softer, the air starts to calm down a little, and everything
          has that “end of summer” warmth to it. Maple Meadows Farm is perfect
          for that kind of day. It has a bunch of great photo spots built right
          into the property, so you're never scrambling to “find” a background.
          You just move around naturally and keep the day flowing.
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Ready in The Loft</h2>
        <p>
          Louise was getting ready upstairs in the Loft, and the lighting up
          there was honestly perfect. Warm, soft and just the right amount of
          contrast for some special timeless photos. Louise had her family and
          friends up in the loft with her. There was a lot of laughing, some
          happy nerves, and a lot of people who clearly love her. Getting ready
          photos can be quiet and calm, or full of movement and emotion, and
          this morning had a bit of both.
        </p>
        <h2>Ceremony in The Meadow</h2>
        <p>
          A few minutes before the ceremony, I met Jon and his groomsmen. It had
          that classic “okay, this is really happening” feeling. The quick
          checks, the last few jokes, the deep breath before walking out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ceremony took place in the Meadow and it looked beautiful. There
          were a lot of heartfelt words spoken and plenty of laughs mixed in
          too, the best kind of ceremony in my opinion. The vibe was relaxed and
          full of people who were genuinely happy to be there.
        </p>
        <h2>Wedding Party Photos</h2>
        <p>
          We used the long driveway out front for a bunch of portraits, and it
          was perfect. It's one of my favourite spots to photograph at Maple
          Meadows because of the leading lines from the driveway and the barn
          and trees as the background.
        </p>
        <p>
          We grabbed a bunch of fun photos with everyone first, just letting
          them be themselves, including Jon's groomsmen attempting to pick him
          up multiple times before we got it right. That set the tone and kept
          everything fun. Then we shifted focus onto Louise and Jon for their
          couple portraits.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my favourite things with couples like this is how quickly you
          can move between moods. We could go from romantic and moody with Jon
          kissing Louise on the forehead, to Jon then licking her nose and the
          two of them bursting out in laughter — no awkwardness, no
          overthinking, just them being them.
        </p>
        <h2>A Rustic Barn Reception</h2>
        <p>
          The barn was decorated beautifully with a rustic vibe. Warm,
          welcoming, and laid out in a way that kept everything feeling
          connected. The head table was centred near the dance floor, with
          family seated on either side of the barn. It made the room feel like
          everyone was part of the same moment instead of spread out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Louise and Jon absolutely crushed their first dance. And then they did
          a combo parent dance where Louise danced with her dad and Jon danced
          with his mum at the same time. It kept the flow of the night moving
          and made it feel like one shared moment instead of two separate
          events. The food was delicious. The speeches were funny and touching.
          And the energy in the room felt like the kind of celebration that
          comes from people truly being happy to show up for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the coolest parts of the day: Jon is originally from the UK,
          and a bunch of friends and family made the trip for the wedding. I was
          seated at a table with a bunch of guests from across the pond and it
          was so much fun talking to and getting to know everyone. We wrapped up
          the night after the cake cutting, and then Louise and Jon went off to
          celebrate with their guests. The perfect ending to the perfect day.

       Nestled in the quaint town of Wainfleet, Ontario, Logan and Colton's
       autumn wedding at Kehoe & Kin was a beautiful celebration of their
       love.

       The day began with Logan and her bridesmaids excitedly getting ready
       for the wedding. I started by taking photos of the details and then
       focused on Logan as she got ready. She looked absolutely stunning,
       like she had walked straight out of a bridal magazine. Her dress,
       veil, and those captivating blue eyes of hers were simply perfect.

       One of the sweetest moments before the wedding was when Logan had her
       first look with her bridesmaids and her father. There was a lot of
       emotion in the air, and it was evident how close they all are. The
       reactions were priceless and their flower girl Juliette couldn't wait
       to see Logan all dressed up.

       The ceremony took place just behind the barn at Kehoe & Kin by the
       pond. The bridesmaids and groomsmen walked down the aisle with grace
       and style. When Logan made her entrance, I couldn't help but sneak a
       peek at Colton. He had tears in his eyes and the most heartwarming
       smile. It was a beautiful moment.

       The wedding ceremony was a heartfelt exchange of vows, filled with
       loving looks and sincere promises. After Logan and Colton shared their
       first kiss as a married couple and walked down the aisle, they were
       showered in cheers and confetti.

       After the ceremony, it was time for some fun with the bridal party. I
       knew they would be a fun group and they didn't disappoint. They were
       up for everything and each photo captured their joy.

       But the most meaningful moments were those shared between Logan and
       Colton. Their love was evident in every photograph. It was clear that
       they are meant for each other. The looks they shared, the little
       whispers between each other, the way each of them lights up when they
       see each other. They made my job as a wedding photographer extremely
       easy.

       As the reception was about to begin we moved inside the beautifully
       decorated barn at Kehoe & Kin, the atmosphere exuded warmth and charm.

       The evening was a mix of delicious food, heartfelt speeches, and
       lively dancing. Logan and Colton's autumn wedding was a celebration of
       love, beauty, and pure happiness. It was a day filled with
       unforgettable moments, a testament to their love and the promise of a
       lifetime of joy together.

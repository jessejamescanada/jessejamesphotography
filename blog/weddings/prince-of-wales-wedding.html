       As a wedding photographer, you sometimes meet a couple where everything just clicks right from the first email. It doesn't feel like work or a client relationship; you can just tell right away that your personalities mesh and it's like talking to an old friend. That's how I felt when Yuka and Zack first contacted me. Things just felt different with them and when we finally met in person for their engagement shoot in June that feeling was confirmed. They're both so kind, genuine, funny, and very clearly in love!

        I was really excited to photograph their wedding and When I arrived at Laura Secord Homestead in Queenston for their ceremony, it felt like I was showing up to shoot a friend's wedding. They had a small and intimate ceremony with their closest family and friends. Yuka's parents even flew in from Japan! During the ceremony there was a lot of nervous laughter, heartfelt vows, and a beautiful first kiss. Once the ceremony wrapped up, Yuka and Zack walked down the isle and out of the church. When we got outside I got to meet all of their guests as they took photos with everyone as the newly married couple!

        We then went to the Botanical Gardens in Niagara Falls with their best man and maid of honor. The weather was great at first as the evening sun began to settle lower in the sky, but I could see some dark clouds on the horizon headed our way. Yuka and Zack are naturals in front of the camera, and it's easy to see how happy they are together. It really shines through in the photos and I think Zack had Yuka laughing every minute or two. And Yuka looked gorgeous in her wedding dress, I love the photo of her holding it and smiling while looking off to the side. Zack looked cleaned up great as well and was a handsome groom!
        <br>
        Those dark rain clouds I saw when we first arrived finally made their way over to us but Yuka and Zack just rolled with it. We had to run for cover a few times, and I even asked if they wanted to head to the reception early but they were up for taking more photos. I love when couples just have fun with it. When we finished up at the Botanical Gardens we jumped in the cars and headed to Queenston Heights to get some shots at the beautiful staircase there. We got lucky and the rain gave us a break for a couple minutes and then started again just as we were finishing up. But Queenston Heights looked amazing with everything soaked and glistening with this happy bride and groom having it all to themselves!

        We then headed to the Prince of Wales Hotel in Niagara-on-the-Lake for their reception. The Vintage Hotels always do things right and this wedding was no exception. We took a few photos outside of Prince of Wales and a few inside and then headed in a delicious dinner. I was lucky enough to get to sit at their table with their families and friends too. I swear, every time I looked over at Yuka and Zack they were laughing and smiling together. It was such a joy to capture their special day. Normally by the end of a wedding I am pretty tired but I left theirs full of energy and in the best mood.

      Congratulations Yuka and Zack :)

          As a wedding photographer, you sometimes meet a couple where
          everything just clicks right from the first email. It doesn't feel
          like work or a client relationship; you can just tell right away that
          your personalities mesh and it's like talking to an old friend. That's
          how I felt when Yuka and Zack first contacted me. Things just felt
          different with them and when we finally met in person for their
          engagement shoot in June that feeling was confirmed. They're both so
          kind, genuine, funny, and very clearly in love!

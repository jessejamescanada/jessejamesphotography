       firsts for me. Like taking a tractor and ATV to get to the location
       way out in a field for a family shoot. And that's exactly what I got
       to experience recently while photographing Greg and his family! When I
       arrived at their house the first thing I was greeted with was a bunch
       of chickens checking out my car and who I was. Then two gorgeous dogs
       came running up to me. Heaven! Greg told me he had cleared a path way
       out on his property for us to go to with a beautiful big Oak tree and
       that we would need to take his tractor and an ATV to get to it. It was
       so much fun. The dogs were running along side us as we were driving
       through the fields and everything.

       We got to our location and it was stunning. With the sun setting and
       the light coming through I knew the photos were going to look amazing.
       And Greg and his family are just naturals in front of the camera. Greg
       and Lindsay just recently (8 days!) had a baby and I loved capturing
       some newborn photos with him sleeping outside in his basket. He
       basically slept for the entire shoot. And his brothers were so much
       fun to capture as well. Everyone looked great, the dogs listened well
       and we got to include the tractor in some photos which the boys
       especially loved. It was hard to choose a few photos to showcase
       because so many turned out from their family shoot!"

          <h2>What is an Elopement?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Want to get married without all the stress, big guest list and huge
          price tag of a traditional wedding? Then eloping in Niagara might be
          perfect for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years I've photographed elopements with anywhere from just
          the couple and two witnesses, to intimate celebrations of 20 guests.
          Sometimes it's just the two of you and I even get to be one of the
          witnesses who signs the marriage license. Elopements are a great way
          to celebrate with your closest family and friends while keeping things
          relaxed, personal and easy to plan.

          <h2>Why elope in Niagara?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Niagara region has always been a popular spot for weddings, and
          Niagara Falls is known as the honeymoon capital of the world. In the
          last few years, elopements here have exploded in popularity with
          couples who want to get married in a beautiful location but keep
          things small and intimate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake offer an incredible variety of
          places to say your vows. Some couples choose to get eloped right in
          front of the Falls and use the waterfall as their backdrop. Others
          prefer one of the nearby parks like Oakes Garden Theatre or the
          Botanical Gardens, and some even have their ceremony on the Hornblower
          boat while the Falls roar just a few hundred feet away. Historic
          Niagara-on-the-Lake adds vintage hotels, charming parks and some of
          the most beautiful wineries and vineyards in Canada to the mix.

          <h2>Planning an Elopement in Niagara?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Often I'm the first vendor couples contact when they start planning
          their Niagara elopement. I've photographed well over 100 elopements
          around the region and I'm always happy to share tips I've learned over
          the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can help you with recommendations on ceremony locations, the best
          spots for photos afterward, and trusted vendors for ministers or
          officiants, flowers, makeup and hair. I can also suggest restaurants
          and venues that work well for a small reception or dinner after your
          ceremony.

          <h2>What's Included in the Elopement Photography Packages?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I offer three elopement photography packages ranging from 1 to 3 hours
          of coverage, and each one can be customized. If you need 1.5 hours
          instead of 2, we'll adjust the package to fit your plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every elopement package includes fully edited, high-resolution images
          in
          <strong>both</strong> colour and black and white. Once everything is
          edited, I'll upload your photos to an online gallery so you can easily
          download your images and share your Niagara elopement with family and
          friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the process, I'm also here to offer any tips or advice you
          need so you can have the best possible experience getting eloped in
          Niagara.

          These are just a few favourites from elopements around Niagara Falls,
          Niagara-on-the-Lake and the surrounding area. Every elopement is
          different, but my approach stays the same: relaxed, low-pressure and
          focused on real moments between you and your partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're planning to elope in Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake or
          anywhere in the Niagara region and you'd like relaxed, candid coverage
          of your day, I'd love to hear from you.

          <img

          <h3>How many guests can we have at our elopement?</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the elopements I photograph in Niagara range from just the
            couple and two witnesses up to around 20 guests. If your guest count
            is a bit higher but you still want things to feel intimate, we can
            chat about what will work best for your locations and timeline.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you help with locations and planning?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. I've photographed well over 100 elopements around the Niagara
            region and I'm always happy to help with location suggestions,
            timing, and vendor recommendations for officiants, flowers, hair and
            makeup and restaurants for a small celebration afterward.
          </p>

          <h3>What happens if the weather is bad on our elopement day?</h3>
          <p>
            Niagara weather can be unpredictable, but we'll always have a backup
            plan. That might mean using covered spots, umbrellas, shifting your
            portrait time or choosing an indoor option nearby. Some of my
            favourite elopement photos have been taken in mist, fog or light
            rain.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you photograph couples travelling in from out of town?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. Many of my elopement couples travel to Niagara Falls
            from other parts of Canada or the U.S. I can help you plan locations
            and timing remotely so you arrive with a clear, relaxed plan for
            your day.

          Weddings in Niagara really are the perfect combination. With beautiful
          parks, beaches, vineyards in <strong>Niagara-on-the-Lake</strong>,
          vintage hotels, large banquet halls and of course the beauty of
          <strong>Niagara Falls</strong>, there's a location here for every kind
          of celebration. It's no surprise couples travel from all over the
          world to get married in the Niagara region.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career I've been lucky enough to photograph over
          <strong>450 weddings across Niagara</strong>. I regularly photograph
          weddings in Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake, St. Catharines and
          surrounding areas like Fort Erie and Hamilton, and I'm always open to
          travel for the right story.

        <h2>How I Photograph a Wedding Day</h2>
        <p>
          Wedding photography has been my main focus since I started my business
          in 2009. I believe it's incredibly important that you feel comfortable
          with the person documenting your day, so I like to meet for a call or
          coffee to make sure our personalities are a good match.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the day itself my goal is to keep things calm, relaxed and fun. I
          give
          <strong>gentle direction</strong> - simple instructions like “hold
          hands, tell each other a joke and walk towards me” - so your photos
          feel natural and genuine rather than stiff and over-posed. I'd
          describe my style as a mix of timeless, classic portraits and candid,
          documentary moments with a modern flair.
        </p>
        <div class="wedding-list-wrapper">
          <ul>
            <li>Relaxed, documentary coverage of real moments</li>
            <li>Gentle posing guidance when you need it</li>
            <li>Plenty of time for family photos without rushing</li>
            <li>Portrait locations chosen to suit your personalities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My goal is for the day to feel easy while your photos still look
            intentional and timeless.
          </p>

          Niagara is an amazing place for a winter wedding. Yes, it's cold, but
          fresh snow, cozy venues and early sunsets make for incredible photos.

            >engagement and couple sessions around the Niagara region</strong
          >. Whether you're local or visiting on vacation, Niagara is one of the
          best places in Ontario for engagement photos - from the Falls and
          parkway to vineyards and quiet wooded trails.

        <h3>How far in advance should we book you?</h3>
        <div class="wedding-faq-wrapper">
          <p>
            Most couples book 9-18 months in advance for peak Saturdays in
            Niagara. If your date is sooner, it's still worth reaching out as
            some weekdays and off-season dates remain more flexible.
          </p>

          <h3>Do you photograph smaller weddings and elopements?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. I regularly photograph intimate weddings, micro-weddings
            and elopements in Niagara Falls and Niagara-on-the-Lake. If you're
            planning something smaller, I can tailor coverage to match your
            plans.

          </p>

          <h3>Will you help us choose locations and build a timeline?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. After photographing hundreds of weddings in the Niagara region
            I know how long things really take and which locations work best at
            different times of day. I'm happy to help you build a realistic,
            relaxed timeline and suggest portrait locations that fit your style.
